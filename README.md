## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the extension running locally for development or personal use.

### Prerequisites

- **Google Chrome** (Latest Version)
- **Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Chrome Extensions**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pushkardangi/remindme-chrome-extension.git
    cd remindme-chrome-extension
    ```

2. **Load the Extension in Chrome:**

    1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
    2. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
    3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder where this project is located.
    4. The extension will now appear in your extensions list.

3. **Test the Extension:**
   - Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup and start adding events.

## Usage

1. **Add an Event:**
   - Input the event name, event date, and choose whether to receive a notification "Once" or "Every Year."
   - Click the **Add Event** button.

2. **View Events:**
   - All saved events are listed in the popup. Events include the name, date, and recurrence type.

3. **Delete Events:**
   - You can delete individual events by clicking the **Delete** button next to the event.
   - You can delete all events at once using the **Delete All Events** button.

4. **Receive Notifications:**
   - The extension will send you a notification when the event date arrives.

## How It Works

- **Data Storage:**
  - Events are stored using Chromeâ€™s `chrome.storage.sync` API, allowing the data to be synced across multiple Chrome installations where the user is logged in.
  
- **Notifications:**
  - The extension uses `chrome.alarms` to check events daily at a set time. If the current date matches any event's date, a notification is triggered.

## Future Enhancements

- **Custom Notification Times:** Allow users to choose custom notification times.
- **Categories:** Let users categorize events (e.g., Birthdays, Anniversaries).
- **Event Edit Functionality:** Provide an option to edit existing events.
